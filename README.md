# Mapping accessibility of electric vehicle charges in Connecticut

## This project demonstrates my ability to collect, clean, and preprocess real-world data, as well as to create meaningful visualizations and extract insights using R. Through this work, I practiced formulating premises, testing them against the dataset, and presenting results in a clear and structured way.

For a school project, I created my own business case. Let'say I am work for a shipping company, which is assessing whether they can use electric cars for deliveries, namely in the state of Connecticut. Therefore I need to gather information on the accessibility of electric vehicle chargers across the state. This project does contain only "data analyst" work.
I test the accessibility by performing hypotheses testing, however this way of testing is not performed properly by using confidence intervals, but rather only by explaining if the premise is true or not, since to answer these questions, I have the full information from the dataset.

The project entailed:

- Finding a suitable open source dataset
- Creating a business case suited to perform "data analyst work" on the given dataset
- Assess the the newly-found information

There are two files, both essentially contain the same information. If the viewer is interested, I recommend reading solely the .html file.

Used language:
R

I performed these procedures:

Creating premises
Data cleaning
Data preprocessing
Data vizualizations
Explanation
Conclusion

The open-source dataset was found on Kaggle)only link due to license restrictions):

**At the same time, I recognize areas where I want to improve â€“ in particular, I realize that formulating static hypotheses is not always the most suitable approach when the end goal is reporting to management. I also see that my analysis lacks concrete recommendations for decision-makers.**
